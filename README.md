# README for 412 - Duckiebot Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the **412 - Duckiebot Project**. The project leverages **Duckiebots** as the primary platform for robotic experimentation, utilizing the **Python** programming language for implementing algorithms and system control. The codebase is designed to interact with Duckiebots, specifically their camera and motor systems, to perform tasks such as lane following and image processing.

The project will be continuously updated as the course progresses, with new features and functionalities being added over time. This README will reflect the evolution of the project, documenting key changes, enhancements, and milestones achieved during the course.

## Key Features

- **Duckiebot Integration**: The project is built around the Duckiebot platform, providing a hands-on experience with robotics, machine learning, and computer vision.
- **Python Programming**: The code is written in Python, utilizing key libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and interaction with the Duckiebot hardware.
- **Real-time Updates**: The repository will be regularly updated to reflect the ongoing development of the project as part of the course curriculum.

## Installation Instructions

Instructions on setting up the project environment and dependencies will be added as the project progresses. Please refer to the latest commit for updated installation guidelines.

## Future Updates

- **Lane Following**: Upcoming implementations will include more robust lane-following algorithms.
- **Image Processing**: Plans to integrate advanced image processing techniques for better interaction with the environment.
- **Docker Integration**: As the project progresses, we will also incorporate containerized deployments using Docker for easier setup and execution.

## Conclusion

This project is a dynamic and evolving effort, designed to showcase the integration of robotics with the Duckiebot platform and Python programming. The README will be updated as new features are implemented and milestones are reached. Stay tuned for continuous improvements as the course unfolds.
