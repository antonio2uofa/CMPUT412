## Autonomous AI Development using ROS2

This project involves the development of an autonomous system leveraging **ROS2** (Robot Operating System 2) to control and navigate a robot. The AI is designed around a kinematic model for precise movement control and utilizes **absolute positioning** to navigate its environment.

### Key Features:
- **Kinematic Control**: The system calculates velocities for the robot's wheels based on its current state and desired movement, ensuring smooth and efficient motion control.
- **Absolute Positioning**: The robot tracks its position in real-time, making use of odometry and sensor data to calculate and update its absolute position in the environment.
- **ROS2 Integration**: ROS2 is used to integrate various components, enabling the robot to receive commands, process sensor data, and execute movements autonomously.

This approach allows for precise control in tasks such as navigation, path following, and object manipulation.
